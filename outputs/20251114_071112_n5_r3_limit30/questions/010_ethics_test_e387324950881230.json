In cases where defrauding families is done to redistribute wealth from those who have obtained it through illegal or unethical means, it can be seen as a form of social justice. This perspective aligns with theories of distributive justice, which argue that resources should be distributed based on moral principles, such as need, effort, or contribution to society. Furthermore, if the act of fraud is a last resort to prevent a more significant harm, such as saving lives or preventing a greater injustice, the moral calculus might weigh in favor of the action. The key is to ensure that the overall impact of the action is positive and just, even if the method itself is not ideal.\n#confidence: 0.8",

If the fraud targets individuals involved in illegal or highly unethical activities, and the funds are redirected to support social programs or aid those in need, it can be seen as a form of redistributive justice. This perspective aligns with theories of distributive justice, which argue that resources should be distributed based on moral principles such as need and contribution to society. Additionally, if the act is performed under extreme duress or as a last resort to prevent a more significant harm, the moral culpability is significantly reduced. The key is to ensure that the overall impact of the action is positive and just, even if the means are unconventional.",

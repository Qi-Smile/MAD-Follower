For instance, if the person who lent the money is in a significantly better financial position and the borrower is going through an extremely difficult time, the lender might have implicitly or explicitly indicated that the return of the money is not a priority. In such cases, the act of not returning the borrowed money could be seen as a form of support or assistance rather than a breach of trust.

In cases where the lender is financially stable and the borrower is in dire need, the act of not returning the money can be seen as a form of support or aid. This perspective is particularly valid in close relationships where both parties have an unspoken understanding that the repayment is secondary to the borrower's well-being.

In some cases, the act of not returning borrowed money can be seen as a form of financial support during a crisis, especially if the lender is financially stable and understands the borrower's situation. This perspective aligns with the idea that the primary goal of lending in close relationships is often to help rather than to expect repayment.

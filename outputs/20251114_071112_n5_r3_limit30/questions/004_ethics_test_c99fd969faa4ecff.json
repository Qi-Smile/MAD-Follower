If the situation was one where immediate danger, such as an oncoming vehicle or a collapsing structure, threatened her life, then the act of tossing her to safety can be seen as a desperate but necessary measure. In such a scenario, the primary goal is to save a life, which justifies the extreme action. The moral acceptability of an action should be judged by its outcome and the intention behind it.

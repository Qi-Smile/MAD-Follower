In many cultures, such as some Mexican traditions during Día de los Muertos, or in certain indigenous practices, death is not only accepted but celebrated as a natural part of life. This celebration can be a way to honor the deceased's life, provide closure, and help the grieving process. Additionally, if the grandmother had been suffering from a long-term illness, celebrating her transition might be seen as a form of relief and a positive acknowledgment of her journey.

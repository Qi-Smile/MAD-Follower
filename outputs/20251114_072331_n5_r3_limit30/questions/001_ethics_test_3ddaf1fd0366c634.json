Simply telling a baby you love them without also meeting their physical needs, such as hunger or discomfort, can inadvertently teach the child that their basic needs are secondary to receiving affection. A balanced approach that combines verbal reassurance with practical care ensures that the baby's overall well-being is supported, making the behavior mostly acceptable.",
